# Deploying Admission Webhooks

## Kind Cluster

It is recommended to develop your webhook with a
[kind](../reference/kind.md) cluster for faster iteration.
Why?

- You can bring up a multi-node cluster locally within 1 minute.
- You can tear it down in seconds.
- You don't need to push your images to remote registry.

## Cert Manager

You need follow [this](./cert-manager.md) to install the cert manager bundle.

## Build your image

Run the following command to build your image locally.

```bash
make docker-build
```

You don't need to push the image to a remote container registry if you are using
a kind cluster. You can directly load your local image to your kind cluster:

```bash
kind load docker-image your-image-namge:your-tag
```

## Deploy Webhooks

You need to enable the webhook and cert manager configuration through kustomize.
`config/default/kustomization.yaml` should now look like the following:

```yaml
{{#include ./testdata/project/config/default/kustomization.yaml}}
```

Now you can deploy it to your cluster by

```bash
make deploy
```

Wait a while til the webhook pod comes up and the certificates are provisioned.
It usually completes within 1 minute.

Now you can create a valid CronJob to test your webhooks. The creation should
successfully go through.

```bash
kubectl create -f config/samples/batch_v1_cronjob.yaml
```

You can also try to create an invalid CronJob (e.g. use an ill-formatted
schedule field). You should see a creation failure with a validation error.
